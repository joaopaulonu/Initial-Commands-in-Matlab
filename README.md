In this lesson, we learned how to use the **MATLAB Editor**, create and save **scripts**, understand the role of the **semicolon (;)**, use **comments (%)**, and organize code into **sections (%%)**.

### 🖥️ Editor vs. Command Window

- **Command Window** → executes immediate instructions (line by line).  
- **Editor** → where we create and save **scripts** (`.m`), functioning like programs.  

Create a script:
- Menu: `New Script`  
- Shortcut: `Ctrl + N`

### 📂 Initial structure of a script

It is recommended to always start the code with:

```matlab
clc; clear; close all;
